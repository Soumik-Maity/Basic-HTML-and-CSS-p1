        <p>
        <ul class="timeline">

            <li><b>1897: </b> Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (née Dutt) and Janakinath Bose on 23
                January 1897 in Cuttack</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1916: </b>In February 1916 Bose was alleged to have mastermind in an incident involving E.F. Oaten,
                Professor of History at Presidency. Before the incident, it was claimed by the students, Oaten had made
                rude remarks about Indian culture, and collared and pushed some students; according to Oaten, the
                students were making an unacceptably loud noise just outside his class. A few days later, on February
                15, some students accosted Oaten on a stairway, surrounded him, beat him with sandal.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1919–1920:</b> Arriving in London on 20 October 1919, Subhas readied his application for the ICS.
                There were six vacancies in the ICS. Subhas Bose took the open competitive exam for them in August 1920
                and was placed fourth. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1921:</b> Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on the morning of 16 July 1921 and
                immediately set about arranging an interview with Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the
                non-cooperation movement that had taken India by storm the previous year and in a quarter-century would
                evolve to secure its independence.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1924-1925:</b> He was also the editor of the newspaper "Forward", founded by Chittaranjan Das. Bose
                worked as the CEO of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for Das when the latter was elected mayor of
                Calcutta in 1924. In a roundup of nationalists in 1925, Bose was arrested and sent to prison in
                Mandalay, where he contracted tuberculosis.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1927:</b> In 1927, after being released from prison, Bose became general secretary of the Congress
                party and worked with Jawaharlal Nehru for independence. In late December 1928, Bose organised the
                Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1930:</b> A little later, Bose was again arrested and jailed for civil disobedience, this time he
                emerged to become Mayor of Calcutta in 1930.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1932-1937:</b> During the mid-1930s Bose travelled in Europe, visiting Indian students and European
                politicians, including Benito Mussolini. He observed party organisation and saw communism and fascism in
                action.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1939:</b> On 22 June 1939 Bose organised the All India Forward Bloc a faction within the Indian
                National Congress,[110] aimed at consolidating the political left, but its main strength was in his home
                state, Bengal. U Muthuramalingam Thevar, who was a staunch supporter of Bose from the beginning, joined
                the Forward Bloc. When Bose visited Madurai on 6 September, Thevar organised a massive rally as his
                reception.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1941:</b> Bose's arrest and subsequent release set the scene for his escape to Germany, via
                Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Late night 16 January 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a
                Pathan (brown long coat, a black fez-type coat and broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified. Bose
                escaped from under British surveillance from his Elgin Road house in Calcutta on the night of 17 January
                1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir Kumar Bose, later reaching Gomoh Railway Station</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1942-1943:</b> When he met Hitler in May 1942, his suspicions were confirmed, and he came to believe
                that the Nazi leader was more interested in using his men to win propaganda victories than military
                ones. So, in February 1943, Bose boarded a German U-boat and left for Japan. This left the men he had
                recruited leaderless and demoralised in Germany.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1944:</b> On 21 March 1944, Subhas Bose and advanced units of the INA crossed the borders of India,
                entering Manipur, and by May they had advanced to the outskirts of that state's capital, Imphal. That
                was the closest Bose came to Bengal, where millions of his devoted followers awaited his army's
                "liberation."</li>
